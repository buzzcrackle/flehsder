### Usage Instructions:

1. Open your redshelf eBook as the right-most tab.
2. Refresh or click next to download pages
3. Find the downloaded files in your downloads folder

### Optional combining script

This is a python script, so you have to have python3 to run it.
This is the command: `python {input folder} {output folder} {name of file}`

Optimally, you would move all your downloaded HTML files into a folder and then run the command.

Caveats: There are pages that do not contain a page number, therefore they are named single_page.
This may result in misordered compilations.
